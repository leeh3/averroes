Our goal is to help young adults comfortably transition into adulthood with a clear sense of self through knowledge, experience, direction, respect, and support. The school is named in honor of Ibn Rushd, the famed philosopher known to the West as Averroes (1126-1198). Referred to as “The Great Commentator” by St. Thomas Aquinas for his authoritative study of Aristotle, Averroes was a trained master in areas of logic, law, medicine, astronomy, geography, music theory, mathematics, and more, and his work is cited in some of the West’s most definitive scholarship.</span><br></p><p>Averroes High School serves a need. The teen years are the most formative years of an individual’s life; a period of intellectual and moral growth. It is during this time most young adults grapple with identity issues, peer pressure, bullying, depression and so on. Without strong role models or a force of spirituality, it is dangerously easy for the average teen to spiral downwards. But with proper guidance and direction, they begin choosing for themselves. Our goal is to provide a space that not only focuses on academic discipline, but prepares students for life.</p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-12"><p><em>IS AVERROES HIGH SCHOOL ACCREDITED?</em></p><p>Averroes High School is A-G approved which means students are able to apply for colleges and universities. Averroes is fully accredited through WASC (Western Association of Schools and Colleges).&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><em>WHAT IS A-G?</em></p><p>The University of California (UC) and California State University (CSU) require entering freshmen to complete certain courses in high school. These courses are called the “a-g” courses because of the letter each subject area is assigned: “a” is for History/Social Science, “b” is for English, and so on. To receive “a-g” credit, a high school course must be certified through the UC course approval process.Here is the list of “a-g”, with the number of years required in each subject. UC  recommends additional years in some areas as indicated.</p><p>a. History/Social Science (2 years)</p><p>b. English (4 years)</p><p>c. Mathematics (3 years, UC recommends 4)</p><p>d. Laboratory Science (2 years, UC recommends 3)</p><p>e. Language Other than English (2 years, UC recommends 3)</p><p>f. Visual/Performing Arts (1 year)</p><p>g. College Preparatory Elective (1 year)</p><p><br></p><p><em>WILL YOU BE ACCEPTING GRADES 11-12?</em></p><p>We prefer students to apply in the freshmen year to experience the 4-year program in order to maximize potential. However, applications are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Therefore, while unlikely, it is possible for a student to enroll in the junior or senior year</p><p><br></p><p><em>WILL MY CHILD BE ABLE TO GO TO A FOUR-YEAR UNIVERSITY AFTER GRADUATION?</em></p><p>Yes, students graduating from Averroes High School can apply and attend a four-year university. However, please keep in mind that admission to university depends on many factors such as a student’s grades, extracurricular activities (ie: work, volunteer, community service, sports, etc.), along with standardized test (SAT/ACT) scores. We work closely with students in all three areas to help them match their desires with a program, university, work experience, or other channels. Students attending our school have been accepted to four-year universities such as Cornell, Berkeley, Purdue, and more...</p><p><br></p><p><em>WHAT KIND OF CLASSES WILL MY CHILD BE TAKING?</em></p><p>Classes will be offered in Language Arts, Math, Science, Social Science, Physical Education, Fine Arts, Arabic, Theology, and Quran. Please visit the academic page for more details.</p><p><br></p><p><em>HOW WILL THE CHILDREN KEEP UP WITH THE RIGOROUS PROGRAM AND ACCELERATED COLLEGE LEVEL CLASSES?</em></p><p>Students will be provided academic support. Students will be taught time management, stress relief and test taking skills. We have an on-site counselor to address the emotional and social needs of students.</p><p><br></p><p><em>DO YOU OFFER AP CLASSES?</em></p><p>Yes, we offer AP Calculus (AB) and more to come. Our students can also take classes at the community colleges such as Ohlone, Mission, DeAnza and other local colleges.</p><p><br></p><p><em>WHAT IF I CAN'T AFFORD TUITION? IS FINANCIAL AID AVAILABLE?</em></p><p>Yes. We also offer scholarships and financial aid based on need. Please visit our financial aid section for more information.</p><p><br></p><p><em>WHY WILL THE STUDENTS BE REQUIRED TO WORK IN THEIR JUNIOR AND SENIOR YEARS?</em></p><p>First and foremost, we encourage students to develop a positive work ethic which prepares them for the real world. Students will be placed in internships in their junior and senior years. This will allow for an opportunity to experience the kind of work they would like to explore upon college graduation. Students also have the option of putting the money they have made directly into tuition payments.</p><p><br></p><p><em>IS THERE A PRE-REQUISITE FOR TAKING COLLEGE COURSES?</em></p><p>Yes, there will be several assessments done by Averroes staff to ensure the student is prepared both academically and socially. There will also be a written examination offered by the college.</p><p><br></p><p><em>WILL THE COLLEGE COURSE CREDITS TRANSFER TO A FOUR-YEAR UNIVERSITY?</em></p><p>Most courses will transfer to a four-year university. We recommend talking to a college advisor to ensure transfer credits.</p><p><br></p><p><em>WHAT IS EXPECTED OF PARENTS?</em></p><p>We encourage a high level of parental involvement at Averroes. We believe positive parental involvement is the backbone of successful education. Parents are required to volunteer a minimum of 4-6 hours a month.</p><p><br></p><p><em>DO YOU PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION TO AND FROM SCHOOL?</em></p><p>Currently, we provide bus transportation to and from the South Bay.</p><p><br></p><p><em>WHAT IS THE TUITION OF THE SCHOOL?</em></p><p>The tuition for the current school year is $13,750/yr with additional fees for registration and travel. Scholarships and financial aid are available under certain conditions. For further information, please visit our financial aid and scholarship section.</p><p><br></p><p><em>IS MY CHILD REQUIRED TO TAKE THE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL EXIT EXAMINATION (CAHSEE)?</em></p><p>No, only students in public high schools must take this exam in order to graduate. Private school students are not required to take this exam.</p><p><br></p><p><em>WHAT STANDARDIZED TESTS WILL MY CHILD TAKE DURING HIGH SCHOOL?</em></p><p>Averroes High School understands that along with grades and coursework, colleges consider SAT or ACT scores, or both. At the appropriate times, your child will be encouraged to take the SAT and ACT. They will also be given information on how to prepare for these examinations, whether it is an upcoming pretest, workshop or prep class.</p><p><br></p><p><em>WILL MY CHILD BE REQUIRED TO PARTICIPATE IN SERVICE LEARNING?</em></p><p>Yes, we have made service learning an essential component of your child’s high school learning experience.</p><p><br></p><p><em>HOW CAN I ENSURE THAT MY CHILD WILL BENEFIT FROM THE COMMUNITY SERVICE REQUIREMENT?</em></p><p>Your child’s teacher(s) will integrate community service into the curriculum through literature and projects. Students will also be placed in facilities of different backgrounds (Islamic charity, youth outreach, assisting the elderly, aiding the ill, etc.) There will also be a student reflection form and agency/supervisor evaluation forms that will be completed once your child fulfills each set of service hours.</p><p><br></p><p><em>DOES AHS OFFER A CATERED AND PERSONAL APPROACH TO EACH STUDENT? ESPECIALLY TAKING THEIR SOCIAL, FAMILY, AND EMOTIONAL SITUATIONS INTO CONSIDERATION?</em></p><p>Being that AHS is so small, one of the most crucial components to our program is the individualized care and attention.  Students are able to move up and down in the levels of their classes and choose their college class electives to tailor their path.  We have students who are following a STEM track and others who are liberal arts.  We also customize the program with the variety of clubs and program we offer (even as a small school with under 50 students).  We have clubs ranging from student council, Media club, the Tech Challenge, and more.  Students are also able to offer some gender-centered activities that allow them to focus in on their issues. There is a strong focus on the social-emotional aspect of students' well being - with the incorporation group circles, individual and group counseling sessions, and indiviual learning plans based on student needs.</p><p><br></p><p><em>DOES AHS FOCUS ON MAKING THE CURRICULUM A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR STEM STUDENTS?</em></p><p>&nbsp;Averroes High School has a very strong “STEM” component.  We offer advanced classes in Chemistry, Physics, and Biology with AP options. We offer the full range of math classes from Algebra I all the way to Calculus B and even Statistics. Our students regularly use technology in the classroom, participate in the tech challenge and the Google Science Fair. Our students also move on to take programming classes in college and pair up with apprenticeships in the tech world. We offer full labs for all of our sciences and support students to get more sciences and math classes at the college level.  As student interests increase in this area we plan to offer even more. Parent support is welcome in this area as well.</p><p><br></p><p><em>WHAT IS THE BALANCE BETWEEN TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIAL INTERACTION?</em></p><p>Students are required to submit their smartphones during the beginning of the day and pick them up at the end of the day. There are no phones in the classroom. Parents will be educated on the appopriate use of technology for student performance.</p></div>
